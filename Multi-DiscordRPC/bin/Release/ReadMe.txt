This is how the JSON file should be formatted in the apps folder:

{
    "app_name": "Google Chrome",
    "app_id": "{APPLICATION ID}",
    "proc_name": "chrome",

    "details": "Watching Youtube",
    "state": "I don't know",
    "large_img_key": "{LARGE ICON}",
    "large_img_text": "Oh hello!",
    "small_img_key": "{SMALL ICON}",
    "small_img_text": "Cats!"
}

You can create your applications in https://discord.com/developers/applications
Once you do, you copy the application ID and put it in "app_id"
